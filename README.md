# opal-html5
Experiments with html5 and the opal ruby to javascript compiler.

1. Hello World

Execute `rake build` to compile the app.js file, then open index.html in your browser and check the console.

2. Simple class

We have now implemented a simple ruby class which is used to output data
to the browser console. We have also included an auto rebuild using rerun.
Use `./build` to initiate the build process and open index.html in your
browser again and view the console.
